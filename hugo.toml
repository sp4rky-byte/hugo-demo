Being in my junior year, I realised that I should probably do some soul searching to figure out what interests me as I near college. I enjoy tech-related stuff, so it kinda made sense to me to build a Hugo website and blog random thoughts, adventures and ideas I get throughout my week as a highschooler. I guess this is sort of a personal diary with random things scattered around- I don't have a schedule but will be decently active (once I understand how to work this thing).
